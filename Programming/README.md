## Skills


- [ ] can explain what an operator is and can list several common ones
- [ ] can explain the concept of operator precedence and can show how to be explicit about it
- [ ] can use the following objects:
  - [ ] Array
  - [ ] Hash / Map
  - [ ] Function
- [ ] can explain what "flow control" means
- [ ] can use the following tools to control the flow of a program:
  - [ ] if / else
  - [ ] return
  - [ ] while / for
- [ ] can articulate the difference between explicit and implicit returns
- [ ] can explain how a function can be passed into another function and can list at least 2 examples of when you might do that
- [ ] can explain what each of these enumerable methods do
  - [ ] each
  - [ ] map
  - [ ] filter
  - [ ] find
- [ ] can explain a callback and give 1 example of when we would need one
- [ ] can read an error backtrace and identify the line of their code that led to that error
